This project provides an interactive dashboard for exploring and analyzing IoT network traffic data. 
It includes multiple visualizations such as label distribution, protocol usage, correlation heatmaps, 
traffic volume analysis, scatter plots, and network graphs. 
It is designed to help understand traffic behavior, detect anomalies, and analyze malicious versus benign activity in IoT environments.
